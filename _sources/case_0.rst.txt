Course Description
------------------
This course explores the fundamentals of SimCenter tools and the DesignSafe infrastructure.
The course employs a self-directed approach, where students are guided through a structured framework designed for this format. 
Over 10 weeks, the course explores the core concepts of SimCenter and DesignSafe, and examines four to five SimCenter tools, focusing
on one tool every two weeks. Students are tasked with mastering the essentials of each tool and delivering presentations to the class.
Additionally, they work through one or more practical examples for each tool, presenting their findings to their peers. Constructive feedback for 
each tool is an integral part of the learning experience. DesignSafe and SimCenter personnel are 
invited to participate through Zoom based on availability. At the end of the course, a final project, 
with a topic of choice for each student, or group of students, is required, providing an opportunity for 
deeper exploration and application of the learned concepts. A final course project report is delivered through a shpinx document stored in a GitHub repository.
 
SimCenter provides next-generation computational modeling and simulation software tools, user support, 
and educational materials to the natural hazards engineering research community with the goal of advancing 
the userâ€™s capability to simulate the impact of natural hazards on structures, lifelines, and communities.

DesignSafe is a comprehensive cyberinfrastructure that provides cloud-based tools to manage, analyze, understand, 
and publish critical data for research to understand the impacts of natural hazards. The capabilities within 
the DesignSafe infrastructure are available at no-cost to all researchers working in natural hazards.

 
Learning Objectives
-------------------

#. Develop a familiarity with Simcenter tools and DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure
#. Develop a familiarity with the breath of SimCenter tools.
#. Develop a suitable background for using HPC resources.
#. Introduce/revise concepts related to structural and geotechnical engineering including UQ concepts, FEM, PB, etc.
#. Provide a working knowledge for selecting, using, and interpreting tools for Structural and geotechnical design and analysis.
#. Introduce markup language to develop easy-to-read, easy-to-write documents in the sphinx python package.


.. Introduction
------------
This section should provide a brief executive summary, giving an overview of the project. It should be written last to ensure it accurately reflects the content of the entire report. Aim for a short paragraph that highlights the key points, objectives, and outcomes of the project.


.. Problem Description
-------------------
Clearly describe the problem being addressed. Use text and images to illustrate the issue, ensuring that even readers unfamiliar with the topic can understand the context and significance. This section should detail the background, relevance, and any previous attempts to solve the problem.


.. Solution Strategy
-----------------
Outline the strategy used to solve the problem. This should include a detailed explanation of the methods, processes, and any equations or theoretical frameworks involved. Be sure to make this section as comprehensive as necessary to fully explain the approach taken.

.. SimCenter Tool Used
-------------------
Provide a brief description of the SimCenter tool(s) used in the project. Explain its relevance and how it was applied. This section should be informative yet concise, offering enough detail to understand the tool's role and capabilities without overwhelming the reader.

.. Example of Application
----------------------
Give a concrete example of how the solution strategy was applied, using text and images. This helps to illustrate the practical application of the theoretical concepts and methods discussed earlier. Ensure the example is detailed enough to show the effectiveness of the solution.

.. Remarks
-------
Use this section for any additional comments or observations that do not fit into the other sections. This could include limitations, unexpected findings, future directions, or any acknowledgments.
