R2D - Liquefaction
==================

Introduction
------------

This page describes basic concepts of geospatial liquefaction hazard modeling withing the umbrella of SimCenter tools. 


Problem Description
-------------------

Coseismic soil liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil is reduced by earthquake shaking. Resilient communities and infrastructure networks, like lifelines or transportation systems, must be built to withstand and respond to hazards posed by coseismic soil liquefaction. Ideally, these predictions could be made:

* quickly, in near-real-time after an event; 

* at high resolution, consistent with the scale of individual assets; and 

* at map-scale, across the regional extent affected by large earthquakes. 


Common liquefaction models in practice require in-situ testing which cannot be continuously performed across large areas, thus presenting the need for “geospatial” liquefaction models. Prior tests of such models (e.g., :cite:`Zhu2017`) have shown both promising potential and severe shortcomings in predicting subsurface conditions with few geospatial predictors. There is a need to advance geospatial liquefaction modeling by integrating geotechnical data, liquefaction mechanics, artificial intelligence (AI), and many geospatial predictor variables to provide reliable regional liquefaction predictions for any earthquake event. When integrated with regional hazard assessment capabilities, geospatial liquefcation models will provide value throughout the life of infrastructure projects - from initial desk studies to refined project-specific hazard analyses - and will unlock insights beyond conventional practice, with opportunity to: 

* prescribe event-specific emergency response and evacuation routes immediately after an earthquake,

* evaluate network reliability and infrastructure network resiliency using structural databases or other asset inventories, and 

* understand the impacts of earthquake events of vulnerable communities using population demographic data. 

Solution Strategy
-----------------

The state-of-practice geospatial liquefaction model is the :cite:`RB2020` model (updated version of the :cite:`Zhu2017` model), which uses logistic regression to predict probability of liquefaction based on five (5) geospatial variables and trained on a database of liquefaction case histories.

In this problem, another modeling solution strategy is proposed, according to :cite:`Sanger2024`. The :cite:`Sanger2024` approach parses the problem into that which is empirical and best predicted by AI (the relationship between geospatial variables and subsurface traits) and that which is best predicted by mechanics (liquefaction response, conditioned on those traits). In this approach, the subsurface traits are characterized at point locations using available cone penetration testing (CPT) data. The liquefaction response at each CPT location is computed across a range of magnitude-scale peak ground accelerations (PGAM7.5) using state-of-practice liquefaction manifestation models (e.g., liquefaction potential index, LPI), thereby retaining the knowledge of liquefaction mechanics developed over the last 50+ years. The relationship between manifestation index and PGAM7.5 is represented as a functional form (Eqn 1) with two curve-fitting parameters: A and B (Fig 1). Therefore, the liquefaction response (i.e., A and B) at each CPT location becomes target variables of supervised learning AI models.  

.. math::
    MI = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
    0, & \text{PGA}_{M7.5} < 0.1g \\
    \arctan(B \cdot (\text{PGA}_{M7.5} - \frac{A}{B})^2) \cdot 100, & \text{PGA}_{M7.5} \geq 0.1g
    \end{array} \right.

**Eqn 1.** Manifestation index as a function of A, B, and PGAM7.5.

    **Fig 1.** Example manifestation curve of LPI vs. PGAM7.5 for a single CPT.

The AI model is trained to predict liquefaction response using a set of 37 geospatial predictor variables that serve as proxies for liquefaction. These predictor variables include metrics of surface topography and roughness, distance to and elevation above water bodies, and information about geology, geomorphology, and hydrology. By applying the trained AI model to these predictor datasets, the A and B parameters are predicted geospatially at 100-meter resolution. A crucial step in this approach is geostatistically updating the AI predictions via regression kriging near field measurements. The effect is that predictions near known subsurface conditions have lower model uncertainty, while predictions farther away rely on the AI model and have higher uncertainty. This method effectively pre-computes liquefaction response for all possible ground motions based on AI-predicted subsurface conditions. These predictions are stored as mapped parameters, ready for use with specific earthquake data, such as a PGAM7.5 raster in R2D.

Model predictions were then tested against the leading geospatial model :cite:`RB2020` in three case-history events using receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve analyses (Fig 2). The :cite:`Sanger2024` AI model (before kriging) performed significantly better than :cite:`RB2020` and was further improved by kriging (Fig 3).

SimCenter Tool Used
-------------------

The presented problem can be solved using SimCenter's Regional Resilience Determination `R2D <https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/r2dtool/>`_ Tool. A substantially complete description of the tool is provided in the `R2D Documentation <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/R2D-Documentation/common/user_manual/about/R2D/about.html>`_. 

The updated :cite:`Zhu2017` model (:cite:`RB2020`) is implemented in the R2D tool (version 4.2.0), whereas the :cite:`Sanger2024` model is not yet implemented in the R2D tool. In this project, the :cite:`Sanger2024` model was implemented in the R2D tool using the `applications.py` file. 


Example Application
-------------------

This example demonstrates the application of the :cite:`Zhu2017` liquefaction-induced ground failure model (really the :cite:`RB2020` model) currently implemented in R2D, and the implementation of the next-generation :cite:`Sanger2024` model described in the **Solution Strategy**. 

.. note::
    In R2D, ground failure models are considered intermediate results that are accessible only through the Earthquake Event Generator tool, and they cannot be executed within the damage and loss assessment tools. Future development in R2D should consider (1) implementing ground failure models with other earthquake hazard source options (e.g., Shakemap Earthquake Scenario), (2) extending the implementation of the ground failure modeling beyond California, and (3) incorporating ground failure models into the damage and loss assessment tools.

**WORKFLOW**

The workflow for the :cite:`Sanger2024` model follows the same steps as the :cite:`Zhu2017` model, with the exception of the referenced geospatial parameters. The :cite:`Sanger2024` model needs only the LPI A and LPI B parameters, implemented here within the DistWater and DistCoast parameters in the R2D tool because the author did not have access to the user-interface code for the R2D tool.

**CODE**

In this example, the :cite:`Sanger2024` model is implemented in the R2D tool using the `applications.py` file, overwriting the `ZhuEtal2017` class for quick integration with the R2D user-interface.

Remarks
-------

.. note::
    Preliminary visualization of the results can be accomplished in the R2D VIZ tab using Graduated Symbols. However, the author recommends exporting the results to a GIS software for more detailed visualization and analysis.

    Note the division spacing issue that arises when the number of divisions is greater than 10. This has been alerted to the developers.
